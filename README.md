# __NoAH__
This is the official implementation of __NoAH__ (Node Attribute based Hypergraph generator), which is described in the following paper:
* __Attributed Hypergraph Generation with Realistic Interplay Between Structure and Attributes__

## __Overview__
In many real-world scenarios, interactions happen in a group-wise manner with multiple entities, and therefore, hypergraphs are a suitable tool to accurately represent such interactions. 
Hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs are not composed of randomly selected nodes but are instead formed through systematic and realistic processes. 
Consequently, various hypergraph generative models have been proposed to explain the fundamental mechanisms underlying hyperedge formation.
However, most existing hypergraph generative models do not account for node attributes, which can play a significant role in hyperedge formation. 
As a result, these models fail to capture the interactions between structure and node attributes.
<br>
To address the issue above, we propose NoAH, a stochastic hypergraph generative model for attributed hypergraphs. 
NoAH utilizes the coreâ€“fringe node hierarchy to model hyperedge formation as a series of node attachments and determines attachment probabilities based on node attributes. 
Moreover, we propose NoAHFIT to fit real-world hypergraphs by estimating the parameters of NOAH. 
Through experiments on nine datasets across four different domains, we demonstrate that NoAH with NoAHFIT outperforms eight baseline hypergraph generative models in accurately capturing the structure-attribute interplay present in real-world hypergraphs.

## __Datasets__
We provide the code for NoAH. We provide the information on the datasets used in the experiment below.

## __Requirements__

__NoAH__ and the evaluation codes were run with the following Python packages:

| Package         | Version   |
|----------------|-----------|
| `networkx`      | 3.1       |
| `numpy`         | 1.26.4    |
| `scikit-learn`  | 1.3.2     |
| `scipy`         | 1.10.1    |
| `snap-stanford` | 6.0.0     |
| `torch`         | 2.3.0     |
| `tqdm`          | 4.65.0    |

You can install them via pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## __How to Run NoAH__
1. Run __NoAH/run_cf.sh__, with designated configuration. 
In particular, you can adjust (1) dataset, (2) seed (random seed), (3) epoch, (4) lr (learning rate), (5) device (CUDA device), (6) wdegreeset (set of degree penalty weight), and (7) wsizeset (set of cardinality penalty weight).
<br>
2. Run __generated/run_reindexing.sh__ with the proper dataset adjustment.
<br>
3. Run __HypergraphProperty/evaluate.sh__ or __HypergraphProperty/ablation.sh__.
